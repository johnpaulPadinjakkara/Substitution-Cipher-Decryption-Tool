Environmental pollution is affecting our daily lives negatively in various aspects of life such as socially  physically  economically  emotionally and intellectually    Contamination of the environment brings lots of diseases which human being may suffer whole life    It is not a problem of community or city  it is a worldwide problem which cannot be solved by the effort of one    If it is not addressed properly  it may end the existence of life a day    Each and every common citizen should involve in the environmental safety programme launched by the government   We should correct our mistakes and selfishness towards our environment to make healthy and safe from the pollution    It is hard to believe but true that only a little positive movements by everyone may bring a huge change in the declining environment    Air and water pollution is leading our health on danger by causing various diseases and disorders    Nothing can be said healthy now a day  as what we eat is already affected by the bad effects of artificial fertilizers which reduces and weakens our body immunity to fight disease causing microorganisms    That’s why  anyone of us can be diseased anytime even after being healthy and happy   So  it is a major worldwide issue which should be solved by the continuous efforts of everyone    We should participate in the World Environment Day campaign to actively participate in the environment safety event   All the natural things which makes life possible on the earth includes under an environment like water  air  sunlight  land  fire  forests  animals  plants  etc    It is considered that earth is the only planet in the universe having required environment for the life existence    Without environment we cannot guess life here so we should keep our environment safe and clean to ensure the life possibility in future    It is the responsibility of each and every individual living on the earth worldwide    Everyone should come forth and join the campaign for environment safety   There are various cycles which happen regularly between environment and living things to maintain the nature’s balance    However  by any means if such cycles gets disturbed  nature’s balance also gets disturbed which ultimately affects the human lives    Our environment helps us and other forms of existence to grow  develop and flourish on the earth for thousands of years    As human beings are considered as the most intelligent creature made by the nature on the earth  they have lots of eagerness to know things in the universe which lead them towards the technological advancement   Such technological advancement in everyone’s life put the life possibilities on the earth in danger day by day as our environment is destroying gradually    It seems that one day it becomes so harmful for life as the natural air  soil and water are getting polluted    Even it has started showing its bad effects on the health of human being  animal  plants and other living things    Artificially prepared fertilizers by using harmful chemicals are spoiling the soil which indirectly getting collected into our body through the food we eat daily    Harmful smokes created from the industrial companies on daily basis are polluting the natural air which affects our health to a great extent as we breathe it every moment   In such busy  crowded and advanced life we must take care of such types of small bad habits on daily basis    It is true that only a small effort by the end of everyone can bring a major positive change towards our declining environment    We should not use the natural resources in wrong ways for just our selfishness and fulfil our destructive wishes    We should grow and develop science and technologies for the betterment of our lives but always be sure that it would not ruin our environment in future in anyways    We should be sure that new technologies would never disturb the ecological balance   IntroductionSimple living high thinking is a common proverb used to emphasize the significance of leading a simple life and having high thinking    If each one of us leads such a life  the world would become a much better place   Mahatma Gandhi is undoubtedly the first name that comes to mind when we hear the proverb – Simple Living High Thinking    Popularly known as  this great man led an extremely simple life    He was highly educated and could have easily got a high paying job    He could have lived in a lavish bungalow and driven expensive cars    However  he chose to live in a hut    He wore the simplest of attires  a dhoti and ate simple food    While his materialistic needs were limited his vision was broad    He was a man of high thinking    He dedicated his life to the nation   India’s independence had become his mission and he followed the path of non-violence to attain the same    His aura was so strong that thousands of Indians got inspired by him and joined him in his struggle for freedom    He initiated various movements and several Indians actively took part in the same    He also addressed masses from time to time to share his words of wisdom and inspired them to dedicate their lives to the freedom struggle    His simple yet effective ways to deal with the tyranny of the British officials were highly appreciated by people    Mahatma Gandhi was one of the main forces to drive the British out of the country   
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dogThe world has literally become a place to show off    Leading a simple life and thinking high is a concept that you can rarely see in anyone anymore    People are extremely busy showcasing how happy  wealthy and full of life they are    While earlier they used to throw parties  invite people over and buy new things to impress those around with the advent of social media the quest to impress others has reached a whole new level    People visit exotic locations  go out for lavish dinners  party with friends  buy new stuff and all this is uploaded on the social media within no time    Rather than enjoying the moment  people have now become more interested in showing others as to how cool their life is    And the definition of cool is far from simple   Those who indulge in such activities regularly are known to have a happening life and everyone wants to befriend them and go out with them    On the other hand  those who do not stay active are considered rather dull and boring    No one likes being around such people    So showing off and talking highly of oneself has actually become the need of the hour    No one wants to live a simple life    Simple is actually considered as boring    Thinking high is beyond question as people are so engrossed in impressing others that they don’t understand that real happiness lies in finding our real selves and helping those around find the same   Someone who tries to defy these new formed norms of the society is considered anti-social or just plain dull and boring    Those who do not keep abreast with this new lifestyle are often left alone    Even if someone cannot afford lavish dinners and doesn’t have a cool gang of friends and leads a simple life  he also tries to impress people by uploading fake pictures and posts on the social media   
With the first day of spring, when the awakening earth puts on its garment of green, and the warm, fragrant air fans our faces and fills our lungs and appears even to penetrate to our hearts, we experience a vague, undefined longing for freedom, for happiness, a desire to run, to wander aimlessly, to breathe in the spring. The previous winter having been unusually severe, this spring feeling was like a form of intoxication in May, as if there were an overabundant supply of sap.

One morning on waking I saw from my window the blue sky glowing in the sun above the neighbouring houses. The canaries hanging in the windows were singing loudly, and so were the servants on every floor; a cheerful noise rose up from the streets, and I went out, my spirits as bright as the day, to go—I did not exactly know where.

One might almost have said that a breeze of love was blowing through the city, and the sight of the young women whom I saw in the streets in their morning toilets, in the depths of whose eyes there lurked a hidden tenderness, and who walked with languid grace, filled my heart with agitation
